sheep.exe 
for windows 32/64bit

Raison d'Etre:
---------------
Mainly, the current sheep.exe "screen-mate" doesn't work on windows 7 64bit, and probably other systems.
But also, it didn't had borat sound effects.

I'm using the very old Visual-Basic 6 since I want a simple project, single EXE, and easy to maintain.

Compiles to windows EXE. 
Might run with WINE.

compiling from source:
Don't believe Win7 if it says it's impossible to run VB.  I'm running visual studio 6, on a Windows 7 64bit, no problems.



todo:
snap sheep to floating windows' borders.
